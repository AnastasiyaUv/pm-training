> What is .gitignore file for?

.gitignore tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. It's usually used to avoid committing transient files from your working directory that aren't useful to other collaborators, such as compilation products, temporary files IDEs create, etc.

> What's the difference between compiled and interpreted language?

A program written in a compiled language must be converted into a different format before it is run. The source code must be transformed into machine readable instructions prior to execution. An interpreted language, on the contrary, does not compile the source code into machine language prior to running the program. It merely interprets the code on the fly. Interpreted languages require a piece of software called an interpreter, which takes the source code and executes one instruction at a time.
